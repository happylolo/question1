# How to Run

Make sure you have `JDK` installed on your machine and the JDK version is greater or equal to JDK 1.8

Open a terminal window and navigate to the repo directory. Run the following commands:

```
$ javac ProblemOne.java
$ java ProblemOne
```

You should be able to see the output. For the specific test case that I'm using please refer to `ProblemOne.java`.
